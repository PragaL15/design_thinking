### 1. **Contrast**
   Contrast refers to the arrangement of opposite elements in a design to create visual interest, excitement, and drama. It is achieved through differences in color, size, value, shape, texture, and other attributes.

   - **Types of Contrast**:
     - **Color Contrast**: 
       - High contrast occurs between colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., red-green, yellow-violet, blue-orange).
       - Low contrast occurs when colors are adjacent on the color wheel (e.g., blue and green).
       - Medium contrast is seen with colors that are part of a triadic color scheme.
     - **Value Contrast**: 
       - High value contrast occurs when light and dark elements are placed together (e.g., black and white).
       - Medium and low value contrasts occur with lighter tones of gray placed next to darker shades.
     - **Size Contrast**: 
       - Contrast can also be achieved by varying the size of objects in a design, with large and small elements placed next to each other.
     - **Shape and Form Contrast**: 
       - Different shapes and forms (e.g., geometric vs. organic) can create a contrast in the composition.
     - **Texture Contrast**: 
       - Combining smooth textures with rough textures creates a dynamic visual contrast.
     - **Line and Edge Contrast**: 
       - Bold, sharp lines next to soft or blurred edges create contrast in the design.
     
   - **Purpose of Contrast**: 
     - To create emphasis, focal points, and visual interest.
     - To guide the viewer’s eye through the composition.

### 2. **Proportion**
   Proportion refers to the relative size or ratio of elements within a composition, or between parts of an object, in relation to the whole composition.

   - **Concept of Proportion**:
     - Proportion is understood as the visual relationship between elements (e.g., visual weight, size, and balance).
     - It helps to establish the relationship between different components in a design.
     
   - **Golden Ratio**:
     - A specific mathematical ratio (1:1.618) often used in art and design to create aesthetically pleasing compositions.
     - Known as the "Golden Mean" or "Golden Rectangle," this ratio is found in nature and many works of art, like **The Last Supper** by Leonardo da Vinci.
     
   - **Common Proportional Ratios**:
     - **1:1**, **1:2**, **2:3**, **3:4**, **4:5**, **5:6**.
     - These ratios are used to guide the placement of elements to achieve visually harmonious compositions.
     
   - **Proportion in Human Form**:
     - The human body grows proportionally from childhood to adulthood, which is often used as a reference in visual design for creating balanced and natural-looking compositions.

### 3. **Scale/Proportion**
   Scale and proportion refer to the comparative size of elements in a design relative to each other or the overall composition.

   - **Scale**:
     - Refers to the size of an object in relation to its surroundings or the overall design.
     - Using varying scales within a composition can demonstrate depth, distance, or emphasis.
   
   - **Proportion**:
     - The ratio between elements and the whole composition. It establishes balance, hierarchy, and can create a sense of harmony or tension.
     - Proportion helps in determining the visual weight and importance of different elements.

   - **Visual Weight and Balance**:
     - Proportion impacts the visual weight of elements within a design, affecting how balanced or unbalanced a composition feels.
     - By manipulating proportions, you can create emphasis on certain elements or disrupt balance to create tension or dynamism.

### 4. **Order**
   Order refers to the organization of elements in a design, creating a sense of structure and clarity.

   - **Importance of Order**:
     - Order in design helps guide the viewer’s eye and ensures that the elements are perceived in a clear, logical sequence.
     - It is often achieved through the use of grids, alignment, and hierarchical structuring of visual elements.
     
   - **Achieving Order**:
     - **Grid Systems**: Using grids to align elements creates an organized and structured layout.
     - **Alignment**: Properly aligning elements in relation to one another creates a sense of order and helps in organizing the visual space effectively.
     - **Hierarchy**: Establishing a visual hierarchy helps prioritize certain elements over others, making the design easy to navigate.

### Summary:
- **Contrast** enhances visual interest and drama by placing opposite elements next to each other.
- **Proportion** ensures visual harmony by maintaining the right relative size and ratios between elements.
- **Scale/Proportion** influences balance, emphasis, and depth within a composition.
- **Order** provides clarity and structure, ensuring the design is organized and easily understood.
