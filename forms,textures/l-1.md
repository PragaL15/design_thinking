#### **Form**
1. **Definition:** Refers to the three-dimensional shape or structure of an object or artwork, influencing      perception and interaction.

2. **Experiments:**
   - **Geometric Abstractions:** Using cubes, spheres, and pyramids in sculptures to interact with environments.
   - **Organic Forms:** Drawing inspiration from nature for fluid and irregular shapes.
   - **Scale Manipulation:** Altering perceptions by varying the scale from miniature to monumental.
3. **Examples:**
   - **Experiment 1:** Geometric forms in urban landscapes to contrast with architecture and nature.
   - **Experiment 2:** Organic forms in natural settings to blend with the environment and enhance viewers' connection to nature.

#### **Color**
1. **Definition:** Affects emotions, moods, and perceptions, creating dynamic visual compositions.
2. **Experiments:**
   - **Chromatic Contrast:** Using complementary colors to impact spatial perception.
   - **Monochromatic Studies:** Exploring emotional responses through shades of a single color.
   - **Color Interaction:** Observing how lighting and time affect color perception.
3. **Examples:**
   - **Experiment 3:** Murals with complementary colors to create vibrant urban spaces.
   - **Experiment 4:** Monochromatic palettes in architecture to influence mood and productivity.

#### **Space**
1. **Definition:** Refers to the dimensions within which art and design exist, including physical and perceptual space.
2. **Experiments:**
   - **Negative Space Utilization:** Defining forms through voids and open spaces.
   - **Scale and Perspective Manipulation:** Using forced perspective to alter spatial perception.
   - **Spatial Interventions:** Designing installations to transform public spaces and encourage interaction.
3. **Examples:**
   - **Experiment 5:** Outdoor minimalist sculptures using negative space.
   - **Experiment 6:** Forced perspective installations in large spaces to create optical illusions.

#### **Texture**

1. **Definition:** The tactile or visual quality of a surface, enhancing sensory and emotional experiences.
2. **Experiments:**
   - **Tactile Experiences:** Creating artworks with varied textures for sensory engagement.
   - **Material Combinations:** Juxtaposing materials to harmonize or contrast with surroundings.
   - **Textural Mapping:** Using textures to convey narratives or cultural significance.
3. **Examples:**
   - **Experiment 7:** Interactive installations with textured surfaces for sensory exploration.
   - **Experiment 8:** Outdoor seating designs combining natural and synthetic materials for aesthetic appeal and durability.

#### **Context and Environments**

1. **Definition:** The setting, including cultural, historical, or social contexts, that shapes the meaning and impact of art and design.
2. **Considerations:**
   - **Site-Specific Installations:** Responding to unique histories and cultures to foster community identity.
   - **Temporal Dynamics:** Exploring how changes in seasons, light, and weather affect perception.
   - **Community Engagement:** Collaborating with communities to create inclusive and meaningful art.
3. **Examples:**
   - **Experiment 9:** Murals or sculptures reflecting cultural narratives to strengthen community bonds.
   - **Experiment 10:** Temporary seasonal art projects responding to environmental changes.
